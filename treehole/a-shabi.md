# a perfect shabi in my dorimitory
After I really acquainted him,through about half a year's living,
I gradually realized that he has always been a big "傻逼" in chinese!
Quite annoying he has been ,and what I can do is nothing.
Anyway,I believe all human own the same feeling of some behavior,
there will somone punish him someday,I believe.
What else,he let me get to know why we invent "下头男",the word. No
word could better be used to describe him ,hahaha.
If you are a regular person ,I bet you would like to kill this "傻逼""下头男”。
Especially  whenever you have a rest,the "傻逼"would come to disturb you .
Nothing could worsen than this,really I have the idea to kill him! 
Go die "傻逼"！
