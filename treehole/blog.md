# Don't know what day was it that day.
Title:
# 2023.4.8 eve
Today I attend the lanqiao competition,to bu honest,it was difficult
for me,though I've not prepared it before.
And what I want to say is that keep away from your dormitory mates,
for you are different from they! They are rich,confidence (whihout brain),
and no dreams,while you're just a poor guy,with a pair of old ,
miserable,parents.Life is so hard for you ,so I miss my childhood,without
concern,anxiety.
I don't know how I can go on a good life together with my family,
I failed my college entrance exam,as a result ,I came to this fuck school.
Work hard? What I can do is little,though I didn't try my best.Just like
this eve,I spent my whole eve's time playing the mobile phone,watching 
the vedios .I can't control myself,though I realize what I was doing and
that is bad! So I miss my childhood again! There was not mobile phone,
what I have is the nature ,the friends,I miss these!
Too much information I take in,and I think too much ,can't focus on daily
work,just think the informatin I look on the phone.Sometime I could think
I'm not myself.
But what can I do except working hard? I can't not focus my attention,
however I still push myself sit on the desk ,learning! 
I wish me could really lead a wonderful,happy life with my family.That 
is remote.And I wish everyone in the world happy too,just this.
What does tomorrrow look like? I don't konw ,I hope I can get lots of
true things ,instead of virtual information.
